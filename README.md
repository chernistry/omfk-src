## The Problem

You're typing, deep in thought... then you look up:

```
Ghbdtn? rfr ltkf&   →   Привет, как дела?
ру|дщ цщкдв          →   hello world
```

Wrong keyboard layout. Again.

**OMFK fixes this automatically, as you type.**

## Features

## Installation

### 1. Download

Get the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/chernistry/omfk/releases/latest).

### 2. Install

Open the DMG and drag **OMFK** to your Applications folder.

### 3. Grant Accessibility Access

On first launch, macOS will ask for Accessibility permission.

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Enable **OMFK**
3. OMFK will automatically start working once permission is granted

> **Note:** Accessibility access is required to monitor keyboard input. OMFK cannot function without it.

---

## Usage

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Toggle auto-correction | Click menu bar icon |
| Cycle through alternatives | Press `Option` |
| Undo last correction | Press `Option` immediately after |
| Exclude an app | Settings → Per-App Rules |

---

## How It Works

OMFK uses an on-device neural network to detect which language you *intended* to type, then converts the text to the correct layout.

- Detection latency: <50ms
- Model runs entirely on your Mac via CoreML
- No internet connection required

---

## Troubleshooting

**"OMFK is damaged and can't be opened"**

Run in Terminal:
```bash
xattr -c /Applications/OMFK.app
```

**Corrections not working**

1. Check Accessibility permission is enabled
2. Quit and reopen OMFK
3. Check if the app is in your exclusion list

**Wrong corrections**

Press `Option` to cycle through alternatives, or disable auto-correction for that app.

## Requirements

- macOS Sonoma (14.0) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac
